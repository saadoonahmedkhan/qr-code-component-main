## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project reinforced my understanding of building simple, responsive card components using HTML and CSS. I practiced structuring a webpage with semantic elements and styling with CSS properties.

```html
<figure class="imgcontainer"><img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR Code"></figure>
```
```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:
- Improve accessibility by adding proper alt text and ARIA labels.
- Enhance responsiveness for different screen sizes.
- Experiment with CSS Grid for better layout flexibility.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Great for HTML and CSS documentation.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - Useful for learning advanced CSS techniques.
